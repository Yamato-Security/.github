## About Yamato Security

Yamato Security is a security group created by Zach Mathis (@yamatosecurity) in 2012.
At first, the main purpose was to provide security training to build a local security community in Western Japan but has grown to provide training, CTF events, webinars, etc... across the country for thousands of people.

Now, with a group of volunteer members, we are providing free open source DFIR tools such as Hayabusa, WELA, Takajo, Suzaku, etc...

Please contact us if you want to help out and contribute.
